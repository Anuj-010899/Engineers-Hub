        <p>Engineer's Hub is a premier GATE coaching institute with 7 centers across the country. We are one of the first education institutes in India which leverages technology extensively to provide quality GATE coaching to our students.

We provide comprehensive and rigorous coaching for the GATE exams. Our student-centered guidance focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of each student. This has enabled us to achieve a proven track record of GATE toppers from our institute. The idea for the Engineer's Hub took birth with the aim of helping budding engineers to discover, reach and exceed their intellectual potential. Engineer's Hub is founded by alumni of Techno Internation New Town. For the first time in India, GATE coaching is being provided under the guidance of former GATE toppers, so as to help young engineering talents to realize their ambitions.

Over the past several years, the team has been working on developing the course curriculum and teaching methodology for the GATE exam. This has also taken a tangible shape in the development of preparatory programs for entrance and aptitude tests for various Public/Government Sector jobs. The design, development and delivery of each of the programs offered at Engineer's Hub incorporate the best teaching practices relevant to the tests.

We have also received many industry recognitions and press coverage. </p>
